// this wwas introduced by ES6 whare by back ticksare used to create strings and also easy string interpolation.
// Example
let cow ="brother Felix coome here"
let no = "I am not coming am sorry"
console.log(`${cow}${no}`);
// the above code is string interpolation
// now lets create multi line code using object literal.

let mviringo =`come
home
today
else
go
home
and
never
come
back`
console.log(mviringo);
